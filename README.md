"Hoops Akil.rmd" shows two Machine Learning methods (Neural Network and Naive Bayes) 
applied to NBA stats to understand what predictors best identify a Hall of fame player.

The dataset dates back to 1979, the year in which the three point line was introduced to the NBA and thusly changing basketball forever. 
Fast forward to 2022, we observe how significant the three point shot is in the modern NBA, almost as if this new version of basketball is a completely
different game.
